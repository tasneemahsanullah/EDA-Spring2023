Invertebrate/shell collecting: during off season","","Hurricanes in 1984 and 1992 destroyed near shore coral; Tour boats sail in this area for whale watching and scenic viewing, occasional snorkeling. Commercial fishing is 10X that for personal consumption. Most personal fishing is spear and line, very little throw net. Chlorox has been reported for commercial fishing. Estimated 6-8 sites in the area each done perhaps once a year. Don't know if this reef is one of them. Expect it is too shallow. Walking on reef; sunscreen from swimmers; lots of debris incl fishing nets brought in from ocean currents; Conservation Zone and SMA District - very little enforcement; Transect coordinates are for Shore Reference Point - a stump at the high tide mark used on 2002and 2004 RCs. The stump had been moved this time but reference point was taken from approximately where the stump had been; Transect Start Point was off shore about 150 ft at 155 deg from stump; Transect was laid from start point approx SW for 100 m ; water temperature 75 deg F, air 85 deg F; water depth was about 2M","",Tunicates (feather dusters) observed around 75-95m.  School of Convict Tang (manini) observerd right outside 40m zone.  About 13 cornet fish observed just outside of survey zone.,"","","","","","",0,0,""

Snowflake eel observed @17m (>1ft), very large sea cucumber @50m, coral damage most likely due to fish predation, 3 drupes spotted in 50 - 70m segment poss. Drupa ricina or Morula uva. Although there were few indicator fish observed, there were several wrasses, surgeons and a school of hundreds of baby - mature akule (scad).

Fresh water springs under the water mixed with ocean water to create visual distortions along the first 40 m of the transect","","due to high local use of this area for fishing, there were fish hooks, fishing line noted on some colonies and rocks. There were some coral colonies that exhibited bleaching. Rough estimate ~20% of coral bleached for the entire 100m survey. Large populations of Palythoa caesia in this area.  Fleshy brown filamentous algae ~ 1 - 3 cm in length covered a majority of the rocks and some coral heads.  Estimated about 75% coverage on rocks.  We are considering the fact that this may be a seasonal bloom and hope to do another survey of this area during the summer months when rainfall is decreased.
